A few days ago I decided to update my site, which was only a site that mostly were links to my social networks. This time I decided that I will include a blog and share content to the world and maybe help one of you.

For now, I'll just explain how is this site build. This site is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org) as the static site generator. The site is build on top of the [portfoYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) theme. The resume section is build on top of the [jekyll-cv](https://github.com/stavrospanakakis/jekyll-cv) theme. Finally, the site is published using github pages.

Happy coding and until the next time!
